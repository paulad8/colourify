### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To create a website with a single main page that displays images which can be added and removed from a separate portfolio page. 

### PROJECT CONCEPT
Art Space is a website that showcases selected artwork of a range of pioneering artitis from the Early Renaissance to modern times. Around 40 artists will be showcased with a short biography and selection of notable works.
All works and artists will be searchable by movement (style), region and medium. Users will be able to search by keyword and be presented with the search result displayed on a new page with the keyword displayed as the header and results organised in a grided card format. 

#### USER OBJECTIVES
- Art is for everybody.
- Art is to inspire.
- Art is joy.
- I am bringing key movements in art history and pioneering masters to the user. To move, to inspire, to educate.  

#### SITE OWNER OBJECTIVES
- Demonstrate competency in the languages and frameworks studied under the Full Stack Development journey
- Create an artwork repository that is compelling, engaging and applies UX principles effectively. 
- Design a visually appealing, fully responsive and accessible website
- Challenge myself by incorporating my newly acquired programming knowledge with my designerly background.

### DESIGN


#### COLOUR PALETTE 
Consistent across all devices, the colour palette was inspired by ... [our big, blue sky and passenger air travel, so shades of blue, grey and white were used.]

#### TYPOGRAPHY
Google Fonts are incorporated into the website. **Major Mono Display** for the heading and sub-headings and **Poppins** for all other scales with a standard sans serif fallback. Major Mono Display was selected to reflect the _arty_ aspect of the site while Poppins is legible and clear. 

#### STRUCTURE
Art Space is a single-page website. 
When a player visits the website, they are greeted with a Welcome message on the landing page. The user clicks a button to enter the quiz, they are then given the option to select their level of difficulty. At this point, the quiz has further navigational features; return to home or help for more information. Once the player has answered all the questions in their chosen level of difficulty, they will be presented with the number of correct responses and the corresponding award (Gold, Silver, Bronze or Try again) and the option to play again, which once clicked, will return them to the home page. 

#### PROTOTYPES
Wireframes, concept prototypes and user journeys were mapped out using [Figma](https://www.figma.com "Figma home").
